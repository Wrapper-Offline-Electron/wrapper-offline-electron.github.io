## What is Wrapper Offline Electron?

Wrapper Offline Electron is an ElectronJS wrapper around Wrapper Offline, which installs all the necessary dependencies automatically without the user having to download them, like Chromium, NodeJS, and other dependencies needed. Flash Player is also provided in Wrapper Offline Electron, so Flash Player doesn't need to be installed either.

## Is Wrapper Offline Electron different from Wrapper Offline?

No, we took their source code entirely and wrapped it around in ElectronJS, so we are the same exact thing. We just maintain the wrapper for ElectronJS here, and all the dependencies needed.

## Why was Wrapper Offline Electron made?

Wrapper Offline only supports Windows, and here, the author (from Wrapper Offline Electron) wanted to expand its support for operating systems out there. Not everyone has Windows. Support for Linux and MacOS was made here, and it was made easy too. Originally, Wrapper and GoAnimate was meant to be cross-platform (be able to be used on Windows, MacOS, Linux), so that shouldn't be wasted and it should be used to our advantage.
